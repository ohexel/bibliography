	abstract = {This paper uses uniquely comprehensive and detailed administrative data on Swedish lineages to shed light on the multigenerational transmission of economic status. Substantial three-generation correlations in long-run income are found. However, the apparent influence of grandparents is almost entirely mediated by socioeconomic correlates other than income in the middle generation, including education (level and field of study), social class, occupation, and wealth. We search exhaustively for heterogeneity in the contribution of grandparents – especially, stronger persistence at the top and bottom – but uncover little influence beyond that transmitted via parents. Finally, we show how an impressive range of spurious results can be generated when data are sparser, or discretion is exerted in model selection. This does not rule out a direct influence of grandparents in contexts other than that studied here, but it does cast doubt on the potential of standard designs to distinguish such influence from model artefacts.},

I examine the intergenerational transmission of racial/ethnic differences in economic security from childhood to young adulthood using data from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. When predicting adult economic security, I find that high parental net worth compensates for low parental income for White children. There is some compensation for Black children but to a weaker degree. Latino/a children are especially upwardly mobile, but parental net worth has little association with adult economic security net of parental income. Overall, the results demonstrate that Black and Latino/a children have much lower economic security than White children, and that economic security is less likely to be reproduced in adulthood.},

Yet many people experience absolute income gains across generations without upward relative mobility. This paper explores the connection between absolute and relative mobility. I show how absolute mobility depends on relative mobility at the population level, in addition to economic growth and income inequality. I connect these population-level absolute and relative mobility patterns to individual-level mobility experiences. Finally, I propose measures to characterize the joint distribution of individual-level absolute and relative mobility experiences. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I describe these joint mobility experiences, including the probability of experiencing upward absolute mobility without upward rank mobility. People from advantaged demographic groups appear particularly likely to enjoy this experience of floating with the rising tide.},

We discuss these limitations which have not received adequate attention in prior literature. Younger sociologists are now abandoning occupational mobility tables—despite their once great popularity—in favor of economic models. The advantages of latter must indeed be considerable given that this switchover would normally be penalized as a lack of disciplinary ``loyalty.''},

The paper descriptively examines the degree to which the gender wealth gap exists in the US and how the gap differs by household structure, age, parental status, and race. Preliminary findings show that the gender wealth gap is significant among both married and unmarried individuals. The gap is larger among the married as compared to never married. Married men own an average of USD30,000 more wealth than married women. These results are particularly poignant considering that previous research examining the gender wealth gap in the US have excluded married individuals.},

There is also widespread public speculation about the role of downward mobility in explaining political upheaval. However, the empirical study of mobility effects faces a fundamental methodological challenge: The linear dependency among among social origin (O), destinations (D), and social mobility (M=D-O), prohibits the use of conventional statistical methods to estimate the unique contributions of the three variables to any given outcome. This paper applies a novel non-parametric bounding approach to partially identify the effects of social mobility. We study the effects of absolute mobility on a range of individual outcomes, such as socio-psychological well-being, political attitudes, fertility, and health. Results indicate that – in contrast to findings from a number of recent studies – the effects of social mobility on individual outcomes are large.},

Using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, I explore heterogeneity in psychological distress levels among upwardly-mobile men and women and find that upwardly mobile individuals most resemble the mean psychological distress levels of their destination class. However, there is greater variation in distress outcomes among those with “extreme” mobility pathways, such as those who move from the bottom income quintile to the top income quintile. Upwardly mobile women tend to experience greater levels of psychological distress.

We apply growth models to two longitudinal data (PSID and NLSY79) of black and white men and women. Preliminary results indicate that educational reproduction is the dominant pattern.

Using data from household wealth surveys conducted in France in 2004, 2009 and 2014, we evaluate the contribution of marital histories to individual wealth across different birth cohorts. For 50 and over, the accumulated wealth depends more on marital history than on professional history, especially for women. Large inequalities in wealth by past marital history are found among single women in recent cohorts: married and widow being wealthier, than divorced, separated or always single.},

Income inequality is measured by the Theil index. The results suggest that selection into partnership covers most of the contribution of educational assortative mating on income inequality. Partnership homogamy explains a growing proportion of the between-group inequality linked to educational assortative mating. Status exchange plays a role, but the overall assortative mating by family background seems to be a more important factor contributing to income inequality.

Given the strong internal labor markets and the gendered career patterns, the Korean patterns may differ. Preliminary analyses show the followings. First, intragenerational mobility exhibits a stable or fluctuating trend during the period of rising inequality. It leads us to reconsidering the relationship between inequality and mobility. Second, men’s mobility pattern was stabilized as they aged, but women’s pattern was not. Interestingly, long-distance mobility was common among women reflecting frequent career disruptions. Occupational segregation by gender and women’s burden associated with family formation is responsible for the gender difference.

(3) Are Black-White differences in SC due to race-related factors or they reflect the underlying socioeconomic characteristics of these two sub-populations? Using PSID data and Bayesian HLM with ``organized dispersion'' I find that Black-White differences in SC (for men) are mostly explained by the higher within-family heterogeneity of Black siblings.

Using the NLSY79, we show that time spent married has positive effects on individuals’ wealth at midlife but that accounting for dynamic selection into and out of marriage reduces these effects substantially. Ignoring the asset-pooling effect of marriage, the effects of marriage on wealth are small.

I argue that due to negative events, more of black wealth is spent insulating both generations from these events. Rather than utilizing wealth in its resource function, or as insurance for high risk/ high reward ventures, two functions that would promote further wealth accumulation, blacks are more likely to have to deplete these resources over time and to use them for purposes that do not promote subsequent wealth accumulation. For this study, I operationalize negative events as the length and number of unemployment events, as well as the length and number of negative debilitating health events.},

Whereas the Great Recession had almost no impact on the net worth of the wealthiest white families, it halved the net worth of the wealthiest Black and Hispanic families and decimated the net worth of the least wealthy families of every racial group. Post-recession, Black families had a median net worth of $0 in contrast to a median net worth of $77, 250 for white families. Regression analyses show that wealth differences between white families and racial minority families were greater in 2013 than before the Great Recession, even after taking into account differences in earnings and demographic characteristics.},

We use quantile regression models to estimate how the associations between different indicators of family background (parental class, parental education, parental occupational standing, and parental wealth) and children’s educational performance vary across the distribution in Germany and in Norway. We find that social origin differences in both countries are concentrated at the bottom and in the middle but are weakest at the top of the distribution.

In particular, high-income families in the US appear able to translate the same amount of financial resources into greater cognitive advantages relative to the middle than those in the other countries. We compare inequalities in other kinds of family characteristics and show that middle-income families in the US are disadvantaged by relatively higher levels of maternal employment and less access to preschool than groups with comparable incomes in the other countries.},

We propose a group-based trajectory approach to characterize population heterogeneity in income trajectories. This approach assigns individuals into several distinct trajectory groups, as compared to the conventional approach that assumes a continuous distribution of trajectories among individuals. We estimate the trajectory memberships of parents and offspring and their interdependence in terms of social mobility probabilities from one generation to the next. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, our results show significant differences in intergenerational income association among groups that experienced divergent income trajectories over the life course.},

As income mobility tends to reduce snapshot measures of income inequality, this might have implications for the true level of income inequality of the four countries. By using a simple random effects model of permanent--transitory income, we show that China has higher level of permanent income inequality than the other countries in our sample. At the same time, the variance of transitory income is also much higher in China than in the West. We end by exploring the determinants of the permanent and the transitory components of income in the four countries.},

We find that lifetime earnings mobility has declined since the early 1980s as inequality has increased. One striking feature is the decline in upward mobility among middle-class workers across the distribution of educational attainment. We find that the likelihood of moving to the top deciles of the earnings distribution for workers who start their career in the middle of the earnings distribution has declined by approximately 20% since the early 1980s. The largest declines in mobility are for women and college-educated workers which is partially explained by rising beginning-career earnings though we note a rise in persistence in the bottom of the earnings distribution as well.},

Moreover, financial transfers increase the probability of home-buying among adult children, net of parental wealth and other characteristics of parents and children. Using data from the HRS, we find that receiving a transfer greater than USD5,000 for any purpose increases the probability of transitioning to homeownership by 13.1%, all else equal; however, the effects vary by race, with parental transfers providing a stronger boost for non-Hispanic white children than others.},

The results show that coresidence with adult children leads to decreases in parental assets and savings. In the years in which their children lived at home, parents were less likely to report owning any assets, and they held 15 percent less in financial assets and 13 percent less in savings compared to years when adult children were not present. By expanding previous research that shows a relationship between increasing economic insecurity, limited wealth, and the rise in coresidence among young adults, this study also offers broader implications for the interconnectivity of financial hardship across generations.},

A second rationale for kin marriage is the fact that less costly marriage assets are exchanged when relatives wed. Using a number of measures, we find no evidence that women whose parents owned land or enterprises (or whose parents owned more land or enterprises of higher value) had higher odds of entering into kin unions, contrary to expectations based on the literature. We do find, however, that women who wed relatives reported lower matrimonial expenditures and higher proportional expenditures by the groom and his family, thus lending support to the second rationale for kin marriage.},

Our models neatly assess the multiple factors that have either reinforced or weakened intergenerational co-residence over time. First, opportunities for intergenerational co-residence have expanded dramatically due to improving parental survival and declining fertility. Second, marriage and migration have diminished co-residence. And, third, net of the previous factors, the normative change towards less co-residence becomes extremely salient, progressing in parallel with the structural modernization of the Spanish society in terms of educational, occupational and activity status.},

Using data from multiple surveys, we apply ordinary least squares and instrumental variables approaches to estimate how a family member’s incarceration influences household wealth. We also quantify the relative fraction of the black-white wealth gap attributable to differential growth in incarceration. Preliminary findings indicate that approximately 21.8 percent of the black-white wealth gap is attributable to incarceration. Our findings demonstrate how contemporary patterns of mass incarceration contribute to the maintenance of social inequality in wealth and form barriers to economic security for other household members.},

Further, cross-cohort comparison reveals that the amount of intragenerational growth of inequality has increased from earlier to later cohorts, suggesting that the labor market plays a more important role in shaping inequality in recent years. Microlevel decomposition analysis suggests that the relative importance of the underlying mechanisms for intragenerational inequality has also shifted: a growing amount of intragenerational growth of inequality is attributable to education-based cumulative advantage and residual inequality.},

However, blacks are markedly less able to reliably transmit advantage to their children. Racial differences are particularly pronounced amongst children from unmarried households and with low parental education. Here, blacks face exceptionally unequal uncertainty: low at the bottom but higher as parental income increases. Blacks still have more uncertain incomes even when they achieve a college degree and marry. This indicates a new “perverse openness” (Blau and Duncan 1967), where black income advantages are less reliably passed on, yet disadvantage persists with invidious reliability. },

With longitudinal data on recent cohorts of children, I use semiparametric decomposition methods to show that differential returns to children’s skills and circumstances, beyond disparities in these attributes, are important contributors to intergenerational educational inequality. This is particularly consequential for bachelor’s degree attainment, as the weaker returns to the attributes of low-SES than high-SES youth exacerbate inequality and may stifle efforts to promote upward mobility. The findings also show that problematic parametric assumptions in typical linear models obscure this modification.},

On average, 36% of European parents divide equally, which contrast with 6.4%-9.2% in US. It is possible that altruistic parents are also concerned with a norm of equal division, and therefore they do not fully offset the income differences. The econometric results show that parents are more likely to give equal transfers if, in their view, income inequality among their children is not too high. Furthermore, the analysis is extended by adding variables at the country level. In this regard, income inequality, pension expenditures, the societal level of altruism and inheritance taxes are key to explain country differences.},

We then compare income based GGC to the ones based on the sociological tradition of unidiff. Our new tool shows more modest GGC correlation, but the remaining link remains substantial.

In our approach, changes in economic status during one’s lifetime are not simply considered as residuals, measurement errors, or transitory fluctuations that lead to biased mobility estimates, but as an essential feature of social status that is inheritable and transmissible. Drawing on longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2013), our preliminary results suggest that income trajectory in the parent generation, both its growth patterns and amount of fluctuations, has important implications for income inequality in the subsequent generation.},

Using data from the 1958 cohort study, this paper examines the extent to which the receipt of help from one’s parents in early adulthood affects the chances of adult-children to reciprocate with support later in life. Results show that provision of support to parents was associated with having previously received support, although with a gradient of reciprocity. Highly demanding types of help provided to parents respond more to the altruism model (especially for daughters), while less demanding provision of help are more responsive to reciprocity norms (especially for sons). },

We examine whether siblings’ wealth positions are more similar when their parents make wealth transfers, suggesting that parental wealth has a compensating or equalizing effect on offspring outcomes, or whether instead parental transfers act to further stratify siblings’ outcomes, as parents make choices about which children will receive transfers. The analysis of cousin correlations in wealth will then reveal whether these equalizing/stratifying effects are still observable in the third generation.

Using newly digitized administrative data covering nearly all legal divorces in the United States between 1867 and 1906, I show that married women’s expanded property rights led to substantial increases in divorce, little of which can be attributed to increased selection into marriage. Increases in divorce were driven by husbands as much as by wives, suggesting that husbands chaffed at wives’ growing economic autonomy at the same time such autonomy allowed more women to end unhappy marriages. The approach illustrates the utility of property rights analysis to studying gender inequality and demographic change.},

Using GGP data for six European countries, I examine how becoming a father changes men’s attitudes in four domains: fatherhood, motherhood, couple-level power dynamics, and gender roles in the public sphere. I find that becoming a father leads men to value motherhood and fatherhood more highly but does not change attitudes towards couple-level power dynamics or gender roles in the public sphere. This indicates that becoming a father affects family-orientedness rather than gender ideology. Results also suggest that increased family-orientedness may drive previous research findings that becoming a father makes men more traditional.},

    abstract = {Economists theorize that men’s marriage premium derives in part from gender specialization in household paid and unpaid labor. We argue that in the current earnings structure, specialization is feasible only for the highest-earning men. In contrast, lower-earning men continue to benefit from marriage if they contribute more to unpaid tasks. We pool 2010-12 American Time Use Survey data and use semi-parametric regressions to estimate the impact of unpaid work at different percentiles of men’s earnings distribution. At no percentile does the inclusion of men’s unpaid time significantly alter their net marriage premium. Greater time in nonroutine housework predicts a further earnings premium for men in the lower quartile of the earnings distribution. At the median, men’s greater time in both nonroutine housework and childcare predicts greater earnings. Partnered men’s greater productivity in family work therefore predicts greater market earnings for average and lower-earning men.},

We employ multilevel models on data from round 5 (2010) of the European Social Survey integrated with data from the Eurostat database. Preliminary descriptive results show a high level of spatial heterogeneity across countries and regions within countries and show that contextual influences are indeed important. In particular, we find that equal-earner families are widespread in contexts characterized by high gender equity as well as in those characterized by high male unemployment. We do not find any influence of gender egalitarian attitudes on the prevalence of female-breadwinner families. Women as main earners, on average, appear to be mainly driven by economic reasons.},

In addition, the study revealed considerable context-specific differences, which point to the long-term consequences of the post-war separation of East and West Germany. First, family structure was less predictive for early family formation in East Germany. Second, the results indicated that the link between childhood family structure and the reproduction of social inequality, which has been found in many studies from the US, could only be replicated for West Germany.},

Then, using multi-level modeling techniques, we explore how normative contexts may condition an individual’s propensity to offer non-numeric responses to a question about the ideal age for cohabitation (i.e. ‘there is no ideal age’ or ‘never’ versus a numeric response), actual ideal ages for cohabitation, and the relative ideal timing of marriage and cohabitation. Results highlight the importance of gender, education and normative ‘permissiveness’ in conditioning perceptions of the ideal timing of cohabitation. Additionally, results suggest the emergence of positive norms for cohabitation within some contexts.},

Children are the most important source of support in old age, especially when there is no partner. In times of rising childlessness we thus face new challenges: On which support networks do childless older people rely? (How) can the lack of children be compensated? Who provides help and care? We assess the support networks of people aged 50 and over in 14 European countries based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). When comparing support networks of childless older people to parent`s networks we focus the importance of the extended family as well as public services. Our analyses show that private help for childless elders is often taken over by the extended family and neighbors. Intense care tasks, however, are mostly provided by public providers. The family and especially intergenerational relations play an important role for support in old age. When there are no children or children live far away, vital support for older persons has to be taken over by public providers in many cases. In countries with low social service provision, older people thus experience a lack of help more likely, especially when depending on vital care.},

Exploiting exogenous variation in the timing of tax refunds, we estimate difference-in-differences models and find that EITC-eligible families increase expenditures on children significantly during the modal months of EITC receipt—by about ten percent—relative to ineligible families. This result is not driven by expenditures on education or luxuries but by enrichment items, and to a lesser extent basic necessities.

This could be a reflection of a pure gender bias on behalf of the parents or a reflection of gender complementarities between parents' and children's expenditures. We find no robust evidence on gender differences in educational investment, measured by kindergarten expenditure. The analysed expenditure patterns suggest a so-far unexamined role of gender in child development.

    abstract = {Do parents favor some children over others? The overwhelming majority of parents state that they treat their children equally, but parents rarely track their spending on each child. We investigate in four studies whether mothers and fathers favor specific children depending on the biological sex of the child. Evidence from the field, laboratory, and community (online panel) showed that parents exhibit systematic biases when forced to choose between spending on sons and daughters. Mothers consistently favored daughters, whereas fathers consistently favored sons. For example, parents were more likely to choose a real prize and give a real U.S. Treasury bond to the child of the same sex as themselves. These parenting biases were found in two different cultures and appear to be driven by parents identifying more strongly with children of the same sex as the parent.},

The essay reveals how structural and cultural barriers contribute to creating social class differences in the ways parents interact with their children, as well as in the way they protect and promote their children's development and well-being. This essay covers some of the foundational research in the field as well as newer research which has started to question the strict social class divide in parental investment. In particular, this essay discusses recent research on the resistance to the dominant ideology of good parenting, and studies of the complex interactions between social class, race and ethnicity, and gender. This essay concludes with a discussion of future research avenues including a call for a better empirical operationalization of the concept of parental investment.}

    abstract={Using 30 years of longitudinal data from a nationally representative cohort of women, we study the association between breastfeeding duration and completed fertility, fertility expectations, and birth spacing. We find that women who breastfeed their first child for five months or longer are a distinct group. They have more children overall and higher odds of having three or more children rather than two, compared with women who breastfeed for shorter durations or not at all. Expected fertility is associated with initiating breastfeeding but not with how long mothers breastfeed. Thus, women who breastfeed longer do not differ significantly from other breastfeeding women in their early fertility expectations. Rather, across the life course, these women achieve and even exceed their earlier fertility expectations. Women who breastfeed for shorter durations (1--21 weeks) are more likely to fall short of their expected fertility than to achieve or exceed their expectations, and they are significantly less likely than women who breastfeed for longer durations (≥22 weeks) to exceed their expected fertility. In contrast, women who breastfeed longer are as likely to exceed as to achieve their earlier expectations, and the difference between their probability of falling short versus exceeding their fertility expectations is relatively small and at the boundary of statistical significance (p = .096). These differences in fertility are not explained by differences in personal and family resources, including family income or labor market attachment. Our findings suggest that breastfeeding duration may serve as a proxy for identifying a distinct approach to parenting. Women who breastfeed longer have reproductive patterns quite different than their socioeconomic position would predict. They both have more children and invest more time in those children.},

Unfortunately, evidence on child-related spending across family structures remains poorly understood. Using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (1996–2015), this study is the first to investigate patterns of child-related spending in an increasingly common type of extended family household: multigenerational households, in which children reside with at least one parent and grandparent. This study also contributes to a growing literature giving primacy to parents' socioeconomic disadvantage as moderating the association between multigenerational relationships and child well-being. Results indicate that, when compared to similar two-generation households, multigenerational households are associated with increased spending on education and with decreased spending on child care. Differences in child-related spending between multigenerational and two-generation households differ according to parents' income and relationship status. Overall, living with grandparents represents an adaptive strategy that helps low-income or single parents invest more money in their children's education, hobbies and activities, and to save on the costs of child care.}

In contrast, this contribution provides the first assessment of trends in educational attainment by family wealth and suggests that we should be at least as concerned about growing wealth gaps in education. Despite overall growth in educational attainment and some signs of decreasing wealth gaps in high school attainment and college access, I find a large and rapidly increasing wealth gap in college attainment between cohorts born in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. This growing wealth gap in higher educational attainment co-occurred with a rise in inequality in children's wealth backgrounds, although the analyses also suggest that the latter does not fully account for the former. Nevertheless, the results reported here raise concerns about the distribution of educational opportunity among today's children who grow up in a context of particularly extreme wealth inequality.},

Social and demographic changes may make multigenerational family ties (e.g., between grandparents, parents, and children) an even more important contributor than ever in perpetuating inequality. The family life course framework, which considers how dimensions of individual (age), sociohistorical (period, cohort), and processual (generation) time intersect, provides a useful structure for thinking about how multigenerational families matter for inequality today.  We integrate these dimensions of time with the ideas of linked lives and cumulative inequality to propose ways in which advantage and disadvantage are transmitted and grow across multiple generations. In particular, we propose an integrative model of linked lives and cumulative inequality that extends the family life course framework into a multigenerational perspective.  We conclude by identifying data sources and methodologies useful for family scholars interested in pursuing a multigenerational family approach to inequality.}

They presented evidence that mixed-gender preference weakened in the 1986–1995 period compared to earlier and coined this change as emerging gender indifference. On the other hand, credible claims and evidence suggest that after 1985, the ``gender revolution'' has stalled. Such arguments suggest that weakened mixed-gender preference will persist. In this study, the authors replicated and extended Pollard and Morgan using 4 waves of data from the National Survey of Family Growth that allow examination of the 1966–2009 period. The results show that the effect of same-gender children on intending/having another child declined in the 1986–1995 period; however, no evidence that this effect has continued to weaken was found. Thus, these data show evidence consistent with a ``stalled revolution.''}

To answer this question, the author analyzed the American Heritage Time Use Study (1965–2013) and showed that the gap between high- and low-educated parents’ time investment in developmental child care activities has widened. An increasing absence of fathers in households with low-educated mothers has exacerbated the trend.

By emphasizing wealth in the production of classed social-emotional competencies not captured by test scores, our findings suggest that the growth of household wealth has a more salient effect for lower- and middle-class adolescents than the highest class which appears to have the least to gain, in terms of social-emotional competencies, from an increase in household wealth.},

As state unemployment rates climbed and consumer confidence fell, high-income families’ educational spending increased relative to low-income families’ spending. Decreases in local housing prices were also associated with lower spending for low-income families.
